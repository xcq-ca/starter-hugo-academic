title: "Determining an Appropriate Placement Test for Introductory Statistics: Preliminary Findings"
abstract: "Viewers will see the process of developing a placement test framework, and the outlining of a remedial course which together can ensure students are placed appropriately and enter their statistics course with the prerequisite knowledge and skill required for success. A discussion of the validation process provides a model that can be applied by others to improve mathematics and statistics placements at their own institutions. Using this data-driven process allows for more informed decisions on test development, revision, and deciding if a placement test is needed. Modern students expect equitable and valid assessments and preparatory courses that are effective well-aligned with their needs. Some helpful considerations are included to support equitable placement test development."
