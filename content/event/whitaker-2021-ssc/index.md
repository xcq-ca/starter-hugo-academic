title: "Developing and revising the Student Survey of Motivational Attitudes
  Toward Statistics: Results from a pilot study"
abstract: Students’ attitudes toward statistics are widely recognized as an
  important outcome for introductory statistics courses. To facilitate measuring
  these attitudes, the Student Survey of Motivational Attitudes toward
  Statistics (S-SOMAS) is currently being developed. This presentation includes
  a brief overview of the development process and theoretical framework chosen
  (Eccles’s Expectancy-Value Theory). The purpose of this presentation is to
  document validity evidence supporting the use of the S-SOMAS, specifically
  evidence about the factor structure and the instrument’s psychometric
  properties. Using data from a pilot administration, alignment of items with
  the theoretical framework is evaluated using exploratory and confirmatory
  factor analysis. Item response theory (partial credit model) is used to
  evaluate the psychometric properties of the items and scales. These results
  are used to suggest modifications and revisions to the S-SOMAS.
