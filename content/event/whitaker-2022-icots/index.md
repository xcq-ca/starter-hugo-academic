title: "A new survey of student attitudes toward statistics: the S-SOMAS"
abstract: "The Student Survey of Motivational Attitudes toward Statistics (S-SOMAS) is a new instrument designed to measure affective outcomes in statistics education. This instrument is grounded in an established psychological theory of motivation (Expectancy-Value Theory) and is being developed using a rigorous process. This paper provides an overview of the four pilot studies that have been conducted during the S-SOMAS development process. Additionally, a description of the methods used for analyzing the data and the way the results are used to holistically make decisions about revisions to the S-SOMAS is included. Brief confirmatory factor analysis results are included from two pilot studies to demonstrate that substantial progress has been made on the development. Once finalized (Spring 2023), the S-SOMAS will be made freely available (http://sdsattitudes.com)."
