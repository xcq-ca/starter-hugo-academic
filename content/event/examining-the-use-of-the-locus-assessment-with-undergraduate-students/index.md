title: Examining the use of the LOCUS assessment with undergraduate students
abstract: The LOCUS (Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics)
  assessments are designed to measure conceptual understanding of statistics in
  ways consistent with the GAISE Framework. Originally designed for high school
  students, there is interest in using the Intermediate/Advance LOCUS forms with
  undergraduate students. Using LOCUS data collected from introductory
  statistics courses , we conducted a preliminary investigation of the validity
  evidence supporting the use of LOCUS with this population. Exploratory factor
  analysis was used to examine the internal structure of the LOCUS with this
  population. Using logistic regression modeling, evidence was found of
  relationships between scale scores obtained from an attitudinal instrument
  (the Survey of Attitudes Towards Statistics) predicted LOCUS score.
  Preliminary findings suggest that administration decisions (e.g., counting the
  LOCUS as a grade or based on participation) may have an effect.
