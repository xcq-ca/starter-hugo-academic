title: LOCUS pilot study and preliminary findings
abstract: "The initial pilot forms of the LOCUS assessments were administered to
  middle school and high school students in spring 2013. A description of the
  pilot study (e.g., number of schools, school characteristics, grade levels,
  number of students) will be presented. Summaries of test results across school
  settings and grade levels will be used to illustrate the informational
  characteristics of the current forms of the LOCUS assessments. Implications
  for the future development of the LOCUS instruments and future administrations
  will be discussed. "
