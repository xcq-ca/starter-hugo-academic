title: "Evaluating validity evidence for instruments in statistics education "
abstract: >-
  This Breakout Session will focus on evaluating validity evidence supporting
  the interpretation of scores from instruments.  While specific instruments
  will be used as examples, this session aims to build skills for assessing
  validity evidence in general. The contemporary view of validity evidence is
  both broader and deeper than ‘an instrument measuring what it is supposed to
  measure.’ However, statistics education is rife with incomplete views
  surrounding the development and use of instruments, and the result is a myriad
  of interpretations and conclusions that are not supported by appropriate
  evidence.


  This Breakout Session will focus on supporting the audience in critically evaluating validity evidence supporting the use of statistics education instruments as reported in the literature. As part of this evaluation of validity evidence, attention will be given to how a lack of evidence threatens interpretations and conclusions as well as how this can be addressed.
