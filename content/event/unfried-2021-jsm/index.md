title: Why Do We Need Yet ANOTHER Instrument Measuring Student Attitudes?
abstract: "Attitudes matter in statistics education, and it is crucial for
  statistics educators to gain a better understanding of student attitudes
  towards statistics as well as the relationship between these attitudes and
  student achievement. Through an NSF IUSE grant (DUE-2013392), the authors are
  developing a new attitudinal instrument, the Student Survey of Motivational
  Attitudes toward Statistics (S-SOMAS), to quantify these attitudes. We will
  share our rationale for developing yet another instrument measuring statistics
  attitudes, and we will discuss the results of the pilot survey administration
  from Spring 2021, including psychometric properties as well as a summary of
  student attitudes. We will also discuss the goals for the remainder of the
  grant, which include the development of statistics instructor and environment
  survey instruments, as well as three parallel surveys for data science. In
  addition, we will present the theoretical framework for these instruments,
  Expectancy Value Theory (Eccles et al., 1983). Statistics and data science
  instructors and educational researchers are encouraged to contact the authors
  for involvement with data collection in future phases of the project. "
