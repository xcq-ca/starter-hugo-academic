title: The impact of collaborative teaching for graduate students
abstract: This session describes a collaborative teaching effort between the
  College of Education at the University of Florida and its affiliated
  developmental research school. Three graduate students with content-area
  expertise in statistics, but without prior K-12 experience, worked with a high
  school classroom teacher to teach the schoolâ€™s first offering of AP
  Statistics. This novel teaching arrangement benefited all parties involved and
  can serve as a model for other collaborations, not just in the content area of
  statistics. Benefits and challenges, including selections of research findings
  and unique teaching strategies arising from this co-teaching experience, are
  presented.
