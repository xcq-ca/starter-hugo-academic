title: Research and data ethics in the statistics classroom
abstract: "Even with increasing state standards, the statistics experience for
  many students does not extend beyond what they learned in grades K-12 or a
  collegiate introductory statistics course. In an increasingly data-driven
  world, students need an understanding of the ethics involved with the
  collection, use, and interpretation of data, and secondary and tertiary
  statistics courses are an ideal setting for this. The need for students to
  understand data and research ethics is more than just to prepare them to be
  researchers: data is collected about and from students constantly (e.g. by
  researchers, administrators, and companies), and students should understand
  why this matters and what the different practices are. Additionally, there are
  certainly students who enter the workplace and are asked to collect and use
  data without even a cursory understanding of data ethics. There are many
  opportunities for teachers of statistics to incorporate research and data
  ethics into a statistics class, and several ideas are given (e.g. having
  students participate in a mock IRB procedure, use of case studies, and a
  compelling lecture). While research and data ethics are not typically included
  in mathematics standards, there is potential for alignment of such activities
  with the Common Core Reading Standards for Literacy in Science and Technical
  Subjects for grades 6-12."
