title: "A Family of Instruments to Measure Data Science Attitudes"
abstract: "Attitudes play an important role in students’ academic achievement and retention, yet quality tools to measure them are not readily available in the new field of data science. Through funding from the National Science Foundation, we are developing a family of instruments that measure attitudes toward data science in the context of an introductory, college-level course. This poster will showcase preliminary results discussing pilot instruments to assess instructors’ attitudes toward teaching data science and an inventory which captures classroom characteristics. This family of instruments, based on Expectancy-Value Theory, will enable data science education researchers to evaluate pedagogical innovations and measure instructional effectiveness relating to student attitudes. We invite instructors of data science courses to join in this discussion and to use these instruments for their own data science education research projects."
