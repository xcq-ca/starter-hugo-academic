title: A framework and survey for measuring studentsâ€™ motivational attitudes
  toward statistics
abstract: The Survey of Motivational Attitudes toward Statistics (SOMAS) for
  Students is part of a family of instruments designed to assess attitudes
  toward statistics. In the SOMAS project, attitudes toward statistics are
  conceptualized broadly, and the instruments are designed drawing from
  Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) (Eccles, 1983). In this way, the SOMAS project
  aims to build upon and extend the work of other attitude measures, e.g. the
  SATS-36. This paper describes the EVT model for students' motivational
  attitudes, the constructs to be assessed by the student SOMAS instrument, and
  future directions for the project.
