title: The development of a professional statistics teaching identity
abstract: Motivated by the increased statistics expectations for students and
  their teachers because of the widespread adoption of the CCSSM, this study
  explores exemplary statistics teachers’ professional identities using a
  theoretical framework informed by Gee (2000) and communities of practice (Lave
  & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). Findings indicate the exemplary statistics
  teachers developed teaching for both mathematics and statistics, though these
  were not always recognized by administrators, other teachers, and parents. Two
  major contributing factors to the development of a statistics teaching
  identity—teachers’ specialized knowledge and teacher isolation—are discussed.
  This work has implications for teacher preparation and professional
  development.
