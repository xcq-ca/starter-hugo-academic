title: "The search for validity evidence for instruments in statistics
  education: preliminary findings"
abstract: "Interpreting results from instruments requires appropriate validity
  evidence. However, evolution in the fields of educational measurement and
  statistics education means that the validity evidence supporting instruments
  is often narrowly focused. For the Validity Evidence for Measurement in
  Mathematics Education project, we are systematically documenting validity
  evidence for instruments used to measure constructs in statistics education
  (such as knowledge and attitudes) for students and instructors. The
  researchers identified instruments measuring statistics-specific constructs,
  where and how these instruments were used, and validity evidence supporting
  their use. A structured literature review approach was used to identify both
  instruments developed since 2000 and studies that used them or contained
  relevant validity evidence. Validity evidence for each instrument was
  documented using a standardized system. Preliminary information about the
  instruments identified, the frequency of their published use, and the amount
  of published work containing validity evidence will be presented. "
