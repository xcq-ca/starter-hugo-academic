title: Using Citrus Leaf Starch Content to Predict Huanglongbing Disease with
  and without a Gold Standard
abstract: "Except for root tissues, healthy citrus trees accumulate very little
  starch, although notable starch concentrations are sporadically observed in
  leaves from zinc deficient trees and injured branches. However, when affected
  by Huanglongbing (HLB; syn. citrus greening) high levels of starch begin to
  accumulate throughout all aerial parts of the tree. Therefore, leaf starch
  content over a threshold level should indicate the presence of HLB. We
  conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of a large number of leaf
  samples throughout the state and compared the results to PCR detection of the
  presumptive causing agent Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. Despite some
  general trends, the data failed to correlate minimum starch levels with PCR
  determination of HLB. Evaluation of the data in terms of biotic conditions
  surrounding HLB infection of citrus trees uncovers a sound rationalization of
  the observed discrepancies. "
