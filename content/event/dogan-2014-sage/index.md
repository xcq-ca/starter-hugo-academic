title: "Lecture plus: How to lecture more effectively"
abstract: Lecture is a common instructional strategy used by college level
  instructors to deliver content material and knowledge to undergraduate
  students and is popular in content-heavy fields.  Our study of 10 recipients
  of Teacher of the Year Awards at UF revealed (among other findings) that
  instructors utilize lecture more effectively when combining it with other
  pedagogy (e.g. problem solving, questioning, and/or discussion) and their own
  characteristics (e.g. commitment to student learning, engaging presentations,
  and/or rapport).  We find that while their disciplines and methods may vary,
  effective instructors can and do use lecture to encourage student learning by
  using “lecture plus.”
