title: "In-service statistics teachersâ€™ professional identities"
abstract: "In the United States, a substantial and increasing amount of statistical content is required for students and teachers in grades K-12. With its own history, aims, and modes of reasoning, statistics is widely regarded as a discipline distinct from mathematics. However, it is generally mathematics teachers who are being tasked with teaching statistical content. Teacher preparation programs tend to focus on preparing teachers to develop their professional mathematics identities; preparation for statistics is often omitted. A statistically-literate society demands teachers well-prepared to teach statistics. This brief research report will describe the professional identities that successful, experienced statistics teachers have developed."
