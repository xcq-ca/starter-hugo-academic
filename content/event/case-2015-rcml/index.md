title: LOCUS: Assessing Students’ and Teachers’ Knowledge of Statistics
abstract: "The Levels of Conceptual Understanding of Statistics (LOCUS) assessments are the product of a multi-year NSF grant (DRL-1118168) designed to measure conceptual understanding of statistics and are aligned with both the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and the American Statistical Association’s Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction of Statistics Education (GAISE) (Franklin et al., 2007). The LOCUS assessments were developed using a modified version of evidence-centered design (Jacobbe, Case, Whitaker, & Foti, 2014) and are available as paper- and-pencil assessments (multiple choice and constructed response items) and as an online assessment (multiple choice items only). The online version provides feedback about the components of the statistics problem-solving process as outlined in the GAISE framework (Formulating Questions, Collecting Data, Analyzing Data, and Interpreting Results) as well as the CCSS standards each item is related to. The assessments have been validated for use with students in grades 6-12; there are on-going efforts to validate the assessments with tertiary level introductory statistics students and pre-service teachers. This presentation provides an overview of the LOCUS assessments, including the development process, the results the operational implementation with 3500 students in grades 6-12, and the on-going validation process with pre-service teachers."
