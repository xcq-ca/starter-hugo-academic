title: "Challenges to using and interpreting the SATS-36 instrument: Do you like
  statistics? Do your students like statistics? How do you know? "
abstract: The Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS-36; Schau, 2003) is
  the most widely-used instrument for measuring attitude-related constructs in
  statistics education (e.g. Nolan, Beran, & Hecker, 2012). However, the SATS-36
  is only an update to the earlier SATS-28 instrument (Schau, 1992), and in the
  decades since the original release, advancements in statistics education
  research have resulted in numerous challenges to the use of the SATS family of
  instruments. This poster will describe some of the challenges facing users of
  the SATS instruments. While some challenges have been previously discussed in
  the literature (e.g. research based on factor analysis and construct alignment
  (Cashin & Elmore, 2005; Vanhoof et al., 2011)), other challenges have not been
  documented thoroughly before (e.g. problems with the Effort construct and
  issues with alignment to the theoretical framework). This poster will describe
  challenges and discuss how these may impact interpretations of research and
  what ways they might be addressed.  Additionally, a clear description of these
  challenges may help teachers using the SATS instruments to learn more about
  their students make more appropriate interpretations of the results. One way
  of addressing these challenges - the development of a new family of
  instruments for measuring students’ and instructors’ attitudes toward
  statistics - will also be discussed.
