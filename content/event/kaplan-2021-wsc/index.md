title: Session of the IASE Journal â€“ Statistics Education Research Journal (SERJ)
abstract: The Statistics Education Research Journal (SERJ) is the flagship
  journal of the International Association for Statistical Education (IASE) and
  the top-ranked journal in statistics education research. In its 20th year of
  publication, with manuscript submissions at a historic high number, the
  journal has moved to an automated Open Journal System (OJS) for submission and
  publication. In addition, the journal is modernizing and will provide DOIs for
  all future and previously published articles. In this session, the Journal
  Editors and Editorial Board will report on the activities associated with
  SERJ. There will be a brief discussion of the history, vision, and goals of
  the journal as well as the types of papers that are sought for both the
  Regular (twice a year) and Special (once a year) Editions of the journal.
  Associate Editors will provide advice to prospective authors, from both the
  quantitative and qualitative research traditions, about key points of
  successful manuscript preparation. Time will be given for participants to ask
  questions and share their perspectives.
