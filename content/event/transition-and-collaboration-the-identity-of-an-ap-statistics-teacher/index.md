title: "Transition and Collaboration: The Identity of an AP Statistics Teacher"
abstract: Statistics has a visible and increasing presence in the K-12
  curriculum. Despite widespread recognition of statistics as a field
  independent of mathematics at the tertiary level and beyond, at the K-12 level
  statistics instruction largely occurs in mathematics classrooms. Without
  appropriate preparation and professional development, this arrangement can
  result in an incomplete treatment of statistics. Mathematics teachers charged
  with teaching statistical content may need to develop a new identity as a
  statistics teacher to be effective. This poster examines the identity of an
  in-service secondary level mathematics teacher engaged in collaborative
  teaching of an Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics course.
