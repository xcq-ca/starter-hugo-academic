title: The Development of Exemplary Statistics Teachers’ Professional Identities
abstract: Statistics and probability represent about one-fifth of the standards
  in the widely-adopted Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM). For
  many states, this represents an increased emphasis on statistical topics. This
  statistics and probability content will be taught by mathematics teachers who,
  by and large, have received little statistical training. In order to teach
  statistics in a way that is faithful to its position as a discipline distinct
  from mathematics (Moore & Cobb, 2000), teachers may need to change their
  beliefs, attitudes, values, and instructional practices related to mathematics
  and statistics. This study conceptualizes these changes as identity
  development. The identity framework used is informed by communities of
  practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) and the work of Gee (2000), among
  others. Beliefs, attitudes, values, and other affective constructs (Philipp,
  2007) are included as components of identity in this conception. The primary
  research question addressed by this study is, ”What learning trajectories help
  to explain the identity of exemplary statistics teachers?” The focus on
  exemplary in-service statistics teachers – recommended for participation by
  experts in the field – represents a type of critical case sampling (Patton,
  2002). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants. Data are
  being analyzed using inductive analysis (Hatch, 2002), and this presentation
  includes preliminary results.
