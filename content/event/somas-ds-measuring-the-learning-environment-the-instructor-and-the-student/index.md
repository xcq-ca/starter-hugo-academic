title: "SOMAS/DS: Measuring the learning environment, the instructor, and the student"
abstract: In order to model and understand best practices in Statistics and Data
  Science education, we need instruments that begin in theory and go through
  validation processes. The recently funded Developing Validated Instruments to
  Measure Student / Faculty Attitudes in Undergraduate Statistics and Data
  Science Education grant (NSF DUE -2013392) will produce a family of
  instruments that will measure constructs about students, instructors, and the
  learning environment salient to statistics and data science education. These
  constructs connect attitudes to an established psychological theory of
  motivation that is guiding the development process. Data has already been
  collected in two pilot studies with statistics students, and instruments for
  use with statistics instructors and data science students are being developed
  this summer. Come learn about the Survey of Motivational Attitudes towards
  Statistics / Data Science (SOMAS/DS) and how you can assist in the data
  collection and validation process.
