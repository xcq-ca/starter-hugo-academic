title: "Surveys of attitudes about statistics: An analysis of items"
abstract: Attitudes toward statistics are considered important outcomes of
  introductory statistics courses because they have been linked with student
  achievement and because they inform people’s lasting impressions of the
  discipline (Gal, Ginsburg, & Schau, 1997; Ramirez, Schau, & Emmioğlu, 2012).
  To chart a route forward, this study examines the original items used on
  survey instruments from the past 37 years to 1) provide a more robust
  understanding of attitudes about statistics as enacted in the literature and
  to 2) clarify how constructs that have used common labels (e.g. “values,”
  attitudes,” and affect”) have been operationalized by different surveys.
