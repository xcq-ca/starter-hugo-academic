title: Measuring statistics attitudes and anxieties
abstract: Both attitudes and anxiety have long been studied in the statistics
  education literature. Recently, efforts have been taken to clarify what is
  meant by these constructs (e.g. Chew & Dillon, 2014). Expectancy Value Theory
  (EVT; Eccles, 1983) is one framework for relating affective constructs to
  student achievement that has seen widespread use such as in the Survey of
  Attitudes Toward Statistics (Ramirez et al., 2012; Schau, 2003). To clarify
  the relationship between statistics anxiety and attitudes, several surveys
  were administered to introductory statistics students including the Statistics
  Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS; Cruise et al., 1985), a measure of opportunity
  cost (Flake et al., 2015), and several scales currently in development. (The
  data will be collected in Spring 2020.) This poster will discuss the potential
  relationships between EVT and statistics anxiety.
