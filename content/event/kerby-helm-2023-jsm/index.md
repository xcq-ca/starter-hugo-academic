title: "Measuring Student Attitudes Toward Statistics using S-SOMAS: National Data and Individualized Report"
abstract: "We will share for the first time pre- and post- data on students' attitudes toward statistics from the new S-SOMAS instrument. At this session, we will show national data on students' attitudes toward statistics and reveal the customizable reports that instructors who participate (past and future) receive about their students and their attitudes compared to the national norms. This survey is part of a family of validated instruments to assess students' attitudes toward statistics or data science, instructors' attitudes toward teaching these subjects, and the learning environment, funded by NSF (DUE-2013392) and performed by the Motivational Attitudes Towards Statistics and Data Science Education Research (MASDER) Team."
