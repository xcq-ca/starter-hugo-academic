title: "Studentsâ€™ understanding of histograms and bar graphs: results from the
  LOCUS assessments"
abstract: >
  Histograms and bar graphs are standard data displays, and fluency with their
  use is a requisite for understanding many important statistical topics. These
  data displays are frequently included in K-12 mathematics curriculum documents
  in addition to being taught in college-level introductory statistics courses.
  Including histograms and bar graphs in standards documents does not
  necessarily imply that students understand them at the expected level. Using
  data from the LOCUS assessments (NSF DRL-1118168) administered to over 3500
  students ages 12-18 in the United States, this poster illustrates the current
  level of student understanding and common misconceptions about histograms and
  bar graphs.
