title: The evolution of items from the LOCUS assessment
abstract: >-
  The goal for this project is to show the evolution of several items from the
  Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics (LOCUS) assessment. Current
  items (that have been through several rounds of revisions by experts in the
  field operating both individually and as teams) will be compared with their
  initial versions. The evolution of the items will illustrate the increases in
  item quality that arise from following the iterative Evidence-Centered Design
  (ECD) process (Mislevy & Risconsente, 2006), suggesting that item (and
  assessment) quality improves with revisions and teamwork. 
  	The evidence map for the LOCUS assessment is based upon the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) framework (Franklin et al., 2007) and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M). The assessment has potential for use by researchers, teachers, and policy-makers 
  	Examining how items were revised from their original conception to the version being piloted this month will show how the iterative ECD process creates items that more closely align with the evidence model for the assessment. Moreover, this will help to establish the content validity of the assessment, and important component of establishing the overall validity. The improvement demonstrated suggests that careful, iterative item development is an integral piece of developing an assessment.
