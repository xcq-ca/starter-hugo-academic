title: The Attitudes and Beliefs of Exemplary Statistics Teachers
abstract: This poster reports results from a study in which exemplary secondary
  school statistics teachers responded to surveys. The three surveys used in
  this study were the Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS-36) (Schau,
  2003), the Epistemic Belief Inventory (Schraw, Bendixen, & Dunkle, 2002), and
  the Indiana Mathematics Belief Scales (IMBS) (Kloosterman & Stage, 1992).
  While the results of the studies are of interest because they contribute to
  limited research on statistics teachers, they are also interesting for
  teachers of statistics who wish to use instruments to assess their studentsâ€™
  attitudes about statistics. In particular, the responses of the exemplary
  statistics teachers to the SATS-36 instrument raise questions about the
  validity of its expanding use with populations beyond undergraduates in
  introductory statistics courses (e.g. pre-service teachers in statistics
  courses or in-service teachers involved in research studies).
