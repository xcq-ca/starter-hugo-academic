title: "The development of exemplary Advanced Placement Statistics teachers "
abstract: "This presentation reports results from a study of the development of
  exemplary Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics teachers. The motivation for this
  study is the increased statistical expectations for grades 6-12 mathematics
  teachers because of the widespread adoption of the Common Core State
  Standards. Studying how teachers overcame the challenges from the rising
  expectations associated with the AP Statistics program may lead to improved
  teacher preparation and professional development for statistics. The
  theoretical framework of identity used in this study was informed primarily by
  Gee (2000) and communities of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998).
  Data from 12 exemplary AP Statistics teachers were collected using
  semi-structured interviews and three surveys: the Survey of Attitudes Toward
  Statistics (SATS-36) (Schau, 2003), the Indiana Mathematics Belief Scales
  (IMBS) (Kloosterman & Stage, 1992), and the Epistemic Belief Inventory
  (Schraw, Bendixen, & Dunkle, 2002). The teachers in this study were primarily
  trained as mathematics teachers, and major factors that contributed to their
  development as statistics teachers are discussed. "
