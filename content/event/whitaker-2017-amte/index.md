title: How mathematics teachers became exemplary statistics teachers
abstract: This study investigated how exemplary statistics teachers—who began
  their careers as mathematics teachers—came to be. Using semi-structured
  interviews and a theoretical framework based on identity, key experiences that
  supported teachers’ development were identified, e.g. isolation and community
  engagement.
