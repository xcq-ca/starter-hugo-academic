title: "Students’ Motivational Attitudes about Statistics: Results from the S-SOMAS Pilot"
abstract: "The Student Survey of Motivational Attitudes toward Statistics (S-SOMAS) is a new instrument being developed to provide teachers and researchers a reliable tool for understanding students’ attitudes grounded in contemporary measurement science. Based on the established Expectancy Value Theory, a psychological theory of motivation, the S-SOMAS aims to provide a broad view of students’ attitudes and related constructs. A full pilot version of the S-SOMAS is now available, and pilot testing is in its second round. This poster will report results from the S-SOMAS pilot administrations, including summaries of student attitudes and analyses that provide evidence about the internal structure of the instrument. Additionally, the challenges faced when measuring certain constructs will be discussed as well as next steps, future directions, and opportunities to participate in future survey administrations."
