title: Validity Evidence Claims and Plan for the SOMAS Instruments
abstract: The Surveys Of Motivational Attitudes towards Statistics (SOMAS) is a
  family of instruments being developed to measure what has previously been
  conceptualized as attitudes in statistics education. For the Student and
  Instructor instruments (S-SOMAS and I-SOMAS, respectively), the SOMAS project
  uses Ecclesâ€™s Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT). While other attitude surveys have
  used EVT in some capacity, EVT is central to the development of the S-SOMAS
  and I-SOMAS instruments. As part of the development process, a robust view of
  validity evidence has been adopted. This poster will articulate explicit
  claims and evidence to be gathered to support these claims using the validity
  framework proposed in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing
  (AERA, APA, & NCME, 2014).
