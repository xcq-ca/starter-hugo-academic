title: " Lessons for the Future from a Year of COVID Teaching"
abstract: The global pandemic has led to a drastic shift in the way we teach,
  moving from mostly face-to-face courses to online and hybrid. Drawing from our
  experiences in the statistics education field and a variety of teaching
  formats, we will share our collective knowledge on online and hybrid teaching
  in statistics and data science. In particular, we will present teaching tips
  and tricks for enhancing student engagement and learning in these settings. We
  hope you leave with ideas that inspire reflections on your own teaching,
  stimulate discussions with your colleagues, and positively influence changes
  within your courses.
