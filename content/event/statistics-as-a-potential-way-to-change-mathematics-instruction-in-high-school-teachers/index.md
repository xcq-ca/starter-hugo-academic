title: " Statistics as a Potential Way to Change Mathematics Instruction in High
  School Teachers"
abstract: "Because of the widespread adoption of the Common Core State Standards
  for Mathematics, the statistics expectations for grade 6-12 teachers have been
  increased, often substantially. This has motivated a study of exemplary
  in-service statistics teachersâ€™ professional identities to better understand
  how exemplary statistics teachers come to be. This poster reports on a piece
  of this larger project, namely how some exemplary statistics teachers made
  changes and improvements to how they teach mathematics classes because of
  their statistics teaching experience. This phenomenon of mathematics teaching
  improving because of statistics teaching experiences may have implications for
  teacher preparation and professional development. "
