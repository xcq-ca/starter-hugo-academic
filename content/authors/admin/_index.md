Douglas Whitaker is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Dr. Whitaker’s primary research area is developing and evaluating psychometrically valid instruments for use in educational contexts. Additionally, he is broadly interested in the teaching and learning of statistics and data science and provides statistical consulting services across disciplines. 

Dr. Whitaker’s current work focuses on measuring attitudes, and he is a member of the Motivational Attitudes in Statistics and Data Science Education Research (MASDER) team. As a member of the MASDER team, he is a Co-PI on an NSF-funded grant to develop a family of instruments for use with students and instructors to holistically measure attitudes and characteristics of the learning environment in statistics and data science education contexts ([DUE #2013392](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2013392&HistoricalAwards=false)). Dr. Whitaker also studies the use of non-Likert-type items for measuring attitudes. 

Dr. Whitaker attended the University of Florida, where he earned his master’s degree in Statistics in 2012 and doctorate in Statistics Education in 2016. As a graduate student, he served as a member of the NSF-funded [Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics](https://locus.statisticseducation.org/) (LOCUS; [DRL-1118168](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1118168&HistoricalAwards=false)) test development project.
