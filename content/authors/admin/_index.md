Douglas Whitaker is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Dr. Whitaker completed his PhD in Statistics Education at the University of Florida, and he was previously an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Stout.

Dr. Whitakerâ€™s research areas are: improving the teaching and learning of statistics and developing high-quality tests and instruments. His current work focuses on measuring attitudes. He is a member of the *Motivational Attitudes in Statistics and Data Science Education Research* (MASDER) team and is Co-PI on an NSF-funded grant to develop a family of instruments for use with students and their instructors ([DUE #2013392](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2013392&HistoricalAwards=false)). Dr. Whitaker also researches the use of non-Likert-type items for measuring attitudes, particularly Evaluative Space Grid (ESG) items. Previously, he was a graduate student on the NSF-funded *Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics* (LOCUS) project and continues to use and document validity evidence using these assessments. In 2017, Dr. Whitaker was named as an AMTE STaR Fellow.
