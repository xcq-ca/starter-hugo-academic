title: Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics (LOCUS)
date: 2021-09-30T01:41:50.492Z
summary: When I was a graduate student at the University of Florida, I worked on
  Tim Jacobbe’s *[Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics
  (LOCUS)](https://locus.statisticseducation.org/)* project. The aim of the
  LOCUS project was to develop statistics tests that measured conceptual—rather
  than procedural—knowledge. The LOCUS project was funded by grant from the
  National Science Foundation
  ([DRL-1118168](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1118168&HistoricalAwards=false)),
  and the assessments are [freely available
  online](http://locus.statisticseducation.org/).
