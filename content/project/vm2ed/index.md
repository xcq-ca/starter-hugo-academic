I am a member of a large team that is documenting validity evidence for instruments and tests used in mathematics and statistics education. The larger project is funded by grants from the National Science Foundation under Grant No. (DRL [\#1644314](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1644314&HistoricalAwards=false) \[PI: Jonathan Bostic], [\#1920619](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920619&HistoricalAwards=false) \[PI: Erin Krupa], & [\#1920621](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920621&HistoricalAwards=false) \[PI: Jonathan Bostic]).
