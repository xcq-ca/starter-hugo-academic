I have been a member of a large team that is documenting validity evidence for instruments and tests used in mathematics and statistics education. The larger project is funded by grants from the National Science Foundation under Grant No. (DRL [\#1644314](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1644314&HistoricalAwards=false) \[PI: Jonathan Bostic], [\#1920619](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920619&HistoricalAwards=false) \[PI: Erin Krupa], & [\#1920621](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920621&HistoricalAwards=false) \[PI: Jonathan Bostic]). I began participating in this project at the 2017 V-MÂ²ED Conference in San Antonio, Texas.
