I am investigating the use of Evaluative Space Grid (ESG) items (e.g., [Audrezet et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1108/JSM-01-2015-0060); [Cacioppo et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0101_2)) in attitude research, particularly for measuring the *Cost* construct from Eccles and colleaguesâ€™ Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT; [Eccles et al., 1983](http://web.archive.org/web/20170701031033/http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/garp/articles/ecclesparsons83b.pdf)). This work is in its early stages and is supported by an internal New Scholars Grant from Mount Saint Vincent University.
