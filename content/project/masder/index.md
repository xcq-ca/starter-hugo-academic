I am a member of the Motivational Attitudes in Statistics and Data Science Education Research (MASDER) group. While there are many interconnected projects undertaken by members of MASDER, the primary focus now is the development of families of instruments to measure student and instructor attitudes and characteristics of the learning environment in the context: the [Surveys of Motivational Attitudes toward Statistics (SOMAS) and Data Science (SOMADS)](http://sdsattitudes.com/wp/).

This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under [Grant No. DUE-2013392](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2013392&HistoricalAwards=false).
