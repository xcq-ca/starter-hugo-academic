  *Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics (LOCUS)* project developed a
  family of tests for measuring statistics knowledge that are [freely available
  online](http://locus.statisticseducation.org/). I joined this project as a
  graduate student and have continued to use these assessments. My current work
  about the LOCUS assessments focuses on validity evidence for their use with
  undergraduate students.
