title: LOCUS assessments
date: 2021-09-30T01:41:50.492Z
summary: "The *Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics (LOCUS)* project developed a family of tests for measuring statistics knowledge that are [freely available online](http://locus.statisticseducation.org/). The aim of the LOCUS project (PI: Tim Jacobbe) was to develop statistics tests that measured conceptual—rather than procedural—knowledge. I joined this project as a graduate student and have continued to use these assessments and document their validity evidence for use with different populations."
