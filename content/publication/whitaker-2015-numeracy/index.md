abstract: "The Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics (LOCUS) project
  (NSF DRL-111868) has created assessments that measure conceptual (rather than
  procedural) understanding of statistics as outlined in GAISE Framework
  (Franklin et al., 2007, Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in
  Statistics Education, American Statistical Association). Here we provide a
  brief overview of the LOCUS project and present results from multiple-choice
  items on the pilot administration of the assessments with data collected from
  over 3400 students in grades 6-12 across six states. These results help
  illustrate studentsâ€™ understanding of statistical topics prior to the
  implementation of the Common Core State Standards. Using the four components
  of the statistical problem-solving process outlined in the GAISE Framework,
  middle and high school students tended to perform better on questions
  assessing Formulate Questions and Collect Data; both groups also tended to
  perform relatively worse on the Analyze Data questions. "
