abstract: "Roads are common in natural landscapes and can have significant
  impacts on wildlife. Most studies have focused on vertebrates and primarily
  addressed the negative impacts of roads. However, roadside margins have the
  potential to support habitat for some taxa, such as pollinating insects. The
  purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in roadside vegetation
  management affect butterflies (Lepidoptera: Hesperioidea and Papilionoidea)
  and floral resources. Specifically, we investigated how mowing frequency
  affects both the abundance and mortality of butterflies and the abundance and
  species richness of herbaceous plants in bloom along highway margins. Three
  different mowing treatments were applied to sections of highway margin in
  Florida, USA: no mowing, mowing every 6 wk, and mowing every 3 wk. Butterfly
  and floral resource data were gathered at regular intervals for 6 mo during
  the peak growing season, from late spring through early fall. Correlations
  between floral species richness and abundance and butterfly abundance were
  calculated. The mowing treatment had a significant effect on floral resources,
  with the 3 wk treatment yielding the lowest abundance and species richness.
  The mowing treatment alone did not have a significant effect on any butterfly
  variable, but the mowing treatment*time interaction had a significant effect
  on live butterfly abundance. The no-mow treatment yielded the greatest numbers
  of live butterflies from late summer into early fall. This study suggests that
  reducing mowing during peak seasonal butterfly activity can increase butterfly
  numbers. Future studies in different regions would benefit from considering
  the effects of time of year of mowing in addition to the frequency."
