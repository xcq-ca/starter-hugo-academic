abstract: "The Motivational Attitudes in Statistics and Data Science Education Research group is developing a family of validated instruments: two instruments assessing students’ attitudes toward statistics or data science, two instruments assessing instructors’ attitudes toward teaching statistics or data science, and two sets of inventories to measure the learning environment in which the students and instructor interact. The Environment Inventories measure the institutional structures, course characteristics, and enacted classroom behaviors of both the students and instructors, all of which interact with the student and instructor background. This paper will discuss our proposed theoretical framework for the learning environment and its development."
