abstract: "Challenges to measuring students’ attitudes toward statistics remain
  despite decades of focused research. Measuring the expectancy-value theory
  (EVT) Cost construct has been especially challenging owing in part to the
  historical lack of research about it. To measure the EVT Cost construct
  better, this study asked university students to respond to items using both a
  Likert-type response and an Evaluative Space Grid (ESG)-type response. ESG
  items enable bivariate responses in a single item and permit distinguishing
  among two different types of neutral attitudes: indifferent and ambivalent.
  This pilot study evaluates the appropriateness of ESG-type items for measuring
  the EVT Cost construct by analyzing student response patterns to ESG-type
  items and comparing them with Likert-type items. Validity evidence is
  documented using descriptive statistics and graphs, correlations among items,
  and a trinomial hypothesis test. Internal consistency reliability indices are
  also reported. Friedman’s Test is used to compare the average response times
  for items of different types. Results indicate that students can meaningfully
  respond to ESG-type items in ways that are similar to their Likert-type
  responses, that students respond to ESG-type items quicker with more practice,
  and that distinguishing among indifferent and ambivalent attitudes seems
  appropriate for the EVT Cost construct. These findings suggest that ESG-type
  items may provide new insights not possible with Likert-type items but also
  that more research should be conducted to better understand their advantages
  and disadvantages within statistics education."
