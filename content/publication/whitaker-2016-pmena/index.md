abstract: Motivated by the increased statistics expectations for students and
  their teachers because of the widespread adoption of the Common Core State
  Standards for Mathematics, this study explores exemplary, in-service
  statistics teachers’ professional identities using a theoretical framework
  informed by Gee (2000) and communities of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991;
  Wenger, 1998). Twelve exemplary, primarily Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics
  teachers participated in two semi structured interviews. Findings indicate
  that these teachers developed teaching identities that cross the borders of
  mathematics and statistics, though these were not always recognized by
  administrators, other teachers, and parents. Two major contributing factors to
  the development of a statistics teaching identity—teachers’ specialized
  knowledge and teacher isolation—are discussed. This work has implications for
  teacher preparation and professional development
