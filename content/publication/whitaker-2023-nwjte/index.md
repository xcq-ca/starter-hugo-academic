abstract: There has been a trend of increased statistical expectations for students and calls for increased statistical preparation for their teachers in recent years, but preparation has not yet reached recommended levels. A similar preparation gap existed at the inception of the Advanced Placement Statistics program, and this study examines a group of statistics teachers identified as exemplary by experts in the field to determine what challenges they faced and how they overcame them. Semi-structured interviews using a Communities of Practice framework (Wenger, 1998) were conducted. The challenges and responses to those challenges are identified, and these have implications for supporting new and established teachers of statistics at the K-12 level.
