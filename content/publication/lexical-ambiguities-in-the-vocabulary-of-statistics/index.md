abstract: "Lexical ambiguities exist when two different meanings are ascribed to
  the same word. Such lexical ambiguities can be particularly problematic for
  learning material with technical words that have everyday meanings that are
  not the same as the technical meaning. This study reports on lexical
  ambiguities in six statistical words germane to statistics classes arbitrary,
  model, random, range, uniform, and variable based on data collected from an
  Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics course taught in the southeastern United
  States. Data was collected at the beginning and end of an academic year. Of
  the six words studied, four (model, random, uniform, and variable) were found
  to have substantial lexical ambiguities. "
