  This  paper  presents
  the  systematic  process  utilized  by  the  Levels  of  Conceptual
  Understanding  in  Statistics  (LOCUS)  project  to  establish  content  validity  for  assessments  measuring  students’  statistical
  understanding in grades 6-12 (ages 11-18). Evidence Centered Design (ECD) was
  used to develop assessments aligned with the United States’ Common Core State
  Standards in
  Mathematics  (CCSSM)  as  well  as  the  Guidelines  for  Assessment  and  Instruction  in  Statistics
  Education  (GAISE).  The  ECD  process  began  with  a  domain  analysis  based  on  CCSSM,  GAISE,  and
  learning trajectories from statistics education research and subsequently
  added layers articulating claims about student proficiency and observable
  evidence to support those claims.  The 

  ECD approach formalized the evidentiary reasoning by which performance on LOCUS can be used to support valid inferences about the larger domain of statistical understanding.
