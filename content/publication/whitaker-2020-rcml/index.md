abstract: Eccles and colleaguesâ€™ Expectancy-value theory (EVT; 1983) has been
  widely-used in education research, and the cost component of this framework
  has recently been the subject of increased research. While advances in
  measuring the cost component have been made (e.g., Flake et al., 2015), an
  on-going instrument development project for measuring attitudes in statistics
  education has encountered difficulties that motivate a deeper look at this
  construct. An overview of cost in EVT, the current state of measuring it in
  statistics education, and plans for a new study are described. The first
  project-specific data are to be collected in Spring 2020.
