abstract: "This constructivist study explores 16 graduate assistants’ (GAs)
  healthcare experiences and uses grounded theory to create a model of graduate
  assistants’ experiences with university-provided healthcare in a large
  research university. The model is composed of four broad components: (a)
  systems; (b) access, care and coverage; (c) knowledge, quality and cost; and
  (d) self. Graduate assistants’ needs and expectations constantly negotiate
  various systems in the model. Expanding upon the limited research regarding
  graduate student healthcare, this study provides implications for higher
  education administrators and policy makers. Based on our study findings we
  argue that it is not sufficient for university administrations to simply
  provide paid health insurance “options” without robust support systems on
  campus. Because students are often stressed out, lack time and energy, and
  find it hard to navigate the complicated systems of profit-driven health care
  industry, the lack of direct support in graduate students’ day-to-day
  healthcare needs can cause tremendous loss on their success and productivity.
  Hence, universities have tremendous opportunities to better understand and
  address their graduate students’ real needs so as to add value to
  institutional success and productivity."
