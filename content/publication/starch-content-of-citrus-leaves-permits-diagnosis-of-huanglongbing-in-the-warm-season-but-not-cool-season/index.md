abstract: One of the most prominent characteristics of huanglongbing (HLB or
  citrus greening)-affected citrus trees is the abundant starch accumulation in
  photosynthetic cells and all other remaining parenchyma cells of aerial parts.
  Under natural conditions, citrus leaves store very low levels of starch and
  detectable amounts are only seen as a result of zinc deficiency or accidental
  girdling of branches. Therefore, leaf starch concentrations over a threshold
  level should indicate the presence of HLB. In this report, we detailed a
  comprehensive statistical analysis of starch levels in citrus leaves and
  compared them with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of the
  presumptive causal agent Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. Starch content was
  found to reliably predict the PCR results (the proxy for HLB presence) during
  the “warm season” (June through November) but not in the “cool season”
  (December through May). During the cool season, starch levels for HLB-positive
  trees tend to be lower, and 43% of samples were incorrectly classified using
  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). In contrast, during the warm season, only
  8% were misclassified. Furthermore, assuming PCR possibly has error, the total
  probability of misclassification for HLB status could be controlled using an
  “uncertain” classification. The temporal pattern of leaf starch is consistent
  with our understanding of seasonal changes in plant development and bacterial
  titer.
