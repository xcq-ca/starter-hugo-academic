abstract: The use of alternative schools as exclusionary discipline for students
  found guilty of committing behavioral infractions raises questions about the
  effectiveness of these schools in producing improved student outcomes.
  Educators' justifications for alternative placements are highly relevant,
  because decisions regarding placements are often subjective and based on
  ill-defined criteria. This mixed-methods study investigates educators'
  perceptions of one disciplinary alternative school in the Southeast and
  educators' justifications for its use. The study examines the district's
  alternative school students' outcome data and analyzes whether these data
  support educators' explanations for why they assign students to the
  alternative school. Findings show that educators often hold mixed beliefs
  about alternative schools, seeing them as both a punishment and as providing
  needed support and services. Students, however, do not demonstrate
  dramatically different academic or behavioral performance as a result of their
  placement, bringing into question educators' justifications for placing
  students in these schools.
