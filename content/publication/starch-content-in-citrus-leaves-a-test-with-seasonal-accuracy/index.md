abstract: One of the most prominent characteristics of huanglongbing (HLB or
  citrus greening)-affected citrus trees is the abundant starch accumulation in
  photosynthetic cells and all other remaining parenchyma cells of aerial parts.
  Under natural conditions, citrus leaves store very low levels of starch, and
  detectable amounts are only seen as a result of zinc deficiency or accidental
  girdling of branches. Therefore, leaf starch concentrations over a threshold
  level should indicate the presence of HLB. In this report, we detail both
  frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches to predict HLB using starch
  levels in citrus leaves. Real-time PCR detection of the presumptive causing
  agent Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus was used as a proxy for HLB status,
  but we also present a competing analysis that does not use PCR as a gold
  standard. Starch content was found to reliably predict the PCR results (the
  proxy for HLB presence) during the “warm season” (June through November), but
  not in the “cool season” (December through May). During the cool season,
  starch levels for HLB positive trees tend to be lower, and 43% of samples were
  incorrectly classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In contrast,
  during the warm season, only 8% were misclassified. Further, assuming PCR
  possibly has error, the total probability of misclassification for HLB status
  could be controlled using an “uncertain” classification. Analysis of the
  biotic conditions surrounding HLB in terms of bacteria life cycle and the
  plant development provides insights into these patterns.
