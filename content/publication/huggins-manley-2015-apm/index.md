abstract: SEAsic (score equity assessmentâ€“summary index computation) is an R
  package for computing and graphing a variety of indices that quantify an
  important aspect of test fairness, that of reported score equity.
  Historically, test fairness has been statistically defined as a lack of
  differential predication and/or a presence of measurement invariance at the
  item level. More recent definitions of fairness include the concept of score
  equity, which calls for additional subpopulation analysis at the equated,
  reported test score level. SEAsic allows for efficient calculation and
  graphing of multiple score equity assessment (SEA) indices. All indices in
  Huggins and Penfield (2012) can be calculated and plotted in various ways
  given a user-provided conversion table. SEAsic is freely available on the
  Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Mac, Windows, and Linux users have
  access to the package via downloading the appropriate version of R or RStudio
  from the CRAN website. Multiple examples of each index computation, variations
  on each index, and plot options are provided in the package manual on CRAN.
