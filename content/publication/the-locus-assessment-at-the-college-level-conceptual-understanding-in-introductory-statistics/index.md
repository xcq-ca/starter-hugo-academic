abstract: "LOCUS is a collection of assessments designed to measure conceptual
  understanding of statistics at  the  levels hypothesized by  the
  GAISE  framework. The original target  population of  the assessments is
  students in grades 6-12, but a version (pre/post) was constructed to meet the
  needs
  of  introductory  statistics  instructors  and  students.  With  the  impleme\
  ntation  of  the  Common  Core  State  Standards,  the  statistical  knowledg\
  e  of  enrolled  students  is  expected  to  change,  and  the  LOCUS  assess\
  ment  for  introductory  statistics  will  be  able  to  measure  that  chang\
  e  and  possibly
  serve  as  a  placement  test.  The  LOCUS  assessment  is  compared  to  the  \
  CAOS  instrument  and  the  ARTIST  project.  Preliminary  results  of  the  \
  validity  study  with  introductory  college  students  are  presented with
  attention given to the utility of the LOCUS assessment for placement
  purposes.  "
