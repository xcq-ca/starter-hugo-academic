abstract: "The Survey of Motivational Attitudes toward Statistics (SOMAS) for
  Students is part of a family of instruments designed to assess attitudes
  toward statistics. In the SOMAS project, attitudes toward statistics are
  conceptualized broadly, and the instruments are designed drawing from
  Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) (Eccles, 1983). In this way, the SOMAS project
  aims to build upon and extend
  the  work  of  other  attitude  measures,  e.g.  the  SATS-36.  This  paper  \
  describes  the  EVT  model  for
  students'  motivational  attitudes,  the  constructs  to  be  assessed  by  t\
  he  student  SOMAS  instrument, and future directions for the project. "
