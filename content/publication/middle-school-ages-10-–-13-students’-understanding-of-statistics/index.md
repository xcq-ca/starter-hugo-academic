abstract: "This  paper  will  present  results  from  the  administration  of  \
  the  LOCUS  assessments  to  measure
  students’  statistical  understanding  in  grades  6-8  (ages  10  –  13).  T\
  he  development  of  these  assessments utilized an Evidence Centered Design
  (ECD) (Mislevy & Riconscente, 2006) approach
  to  establish  their  content  validity.  After  an  iterative  development  \
  process,  these  assessments  were  administered  to  over 2,000  students
  in  the  United  States.  Student  performance in  each  of the  four  areas
  of the statistical problem solving process - formulating questions, collecting
  data, analyzing
  data,  and  interpreting  results  -  will  be  discussed,  and  examples  of  \
  multiple-choice  items  will  be  provided. "
