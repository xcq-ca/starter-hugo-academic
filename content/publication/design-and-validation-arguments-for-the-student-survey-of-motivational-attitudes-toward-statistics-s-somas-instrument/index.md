abstract: This chapter describes the development plan for a new survey designed
  to measure studentsâ€™ attitudes toward statistics aligned with expectancy value
  theory, the S-SOMAS. Included in this description are the context and
  motivation for developing a new instrument, a brief overview of the
  theoretical framework, and the validity evidence to be collected to support
  the intended uses of the S-SOMAS. The S-SOMAS is currently in development and
  pilot data have been collected; as such, this chapter includes both planned
  and enacted elements of instrument development. This chapter also provides
  readers with an illustration about the early stages of validation work and
  some choices that instrument developers may encounter.
