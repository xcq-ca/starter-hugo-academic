abstract: "This  paper  will  present  results  from  the  administration  of  \
  the  LOCUS  assessments  to  measure  students’  statistical  understanding  \
  in  grades  9-12  (ages  14  –  18).  The  development  of  these  assessments
  utilized an Evidence Centered Design (ECD) (Mislevy & Riconscente, 2006)
  approach
  to  establish  their  content  validity.  After  an  iterative  development  \
  process,  these  assessments  were  administered  to  over 2,000  students
  in  the  United  States.  Student  performance in  each  of the  four  areas
  of the statistical problem solving process - formulating questions, collecting
  data, analyzing data, and interpreting results - will be discussed, and
  examples of multiple-choice and constructed-response items will be provided. "
