abstract: Education research has established that teachers' beliefs matter
  because they can affect classroom practices and student outcomes, and beliefs
  are viewed as an important construct within statistics education. However,
  relatively little research about the beliefs of in-service statistics teachers
  has been conducted. Additionally, little research has been conducted with
  highly-experienced statistics teachers rather than pre-service teachers or
  typical teachers. Using two survey instruments, this study describes the
  beliefs about knowledge and beliefs about mathematical problem-solving for a
  sample of exemplary statistics teachers. The exemplary statistics teachers in
  this study responded to the Epistemic Beliefs Inventory and the Indiana
  Mathematics Belief Scales. Results show that the exemplary statistics teachers
  in this study had mature epistemic beliefs and strongly positive beliefs
  toward mathematical problem-solving, but notable patterns of similar responses
  that run counter to these trends were observed and are discussed.
